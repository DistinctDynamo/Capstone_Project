# Introduction

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to collect, analyze, and define the
high-level needs and features of the Soccer Connect system. It focuses
on the capabilities needed by the stakeholders, and the target users,
and why these needs exist. The details of how the Soccer Connect System
fulfils these needs are detailed in the use cases and supplementary
specifications.

## Scope

This Vision Document applies to the Soccer Connect system which will be
developed by the development team. The development team will develop
this client-server system to interface with user devices, primarily
computers.

### In Scope

The Soccer Connect application allows users to connect with the wider
soccer playing/enjoying community of their region in a variety of ways.
Including booking fields and play spaces, organizations can post job
listings and inform potential players of openings on teams and offers a
community hub where users can interact with one another.

# Assumptions

*\<List all assumptions made about any of the content provided in this
document. Assumptions should be applicable to the scope, desired
solution, requirements, business process, and stakeholders \>*

# Constraints

*\<List any process constraints, external constraints or other
dependencies \>*

Security

- User info which includes username and passwords which need to be
  stored in a database server

- Two factor authentication

- Users sign in with a username and password

- Encrypting/securing communications not just between users but from the
  system to databases

Usability

- Font size, color choices

- Layout in conjunction with advertisement is legible

- Easy to use

Capacity

- Based on technology used there is maximum limit to the number of
  active logged in users.

Cost

- Since we are a small team there is probably a cost associated with
  technology required to enable features.

Scope

- As development occurs there could be a growth in the number of
  features initially desired by the team that does not align with
  features required by stakeholders.

Time
